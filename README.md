# Hi, I’m Harshitha Kakani!
### Recent MPH Graduate | Public Health Data Scientist | Bioinformatics & Genetic Epidemiology Researcher

Welcome to my professional GitHub portfolio. I recently recieved my Master of Public Health from the University of Miami in December 2025 with research experience in **computational biology, molecular/genetic epidemiology, infectious disease surveillance, and health policy analytics**.

I work across **R, Tableau, SAS, SQL, RedCap, and HPC** to analyze large-scale datasets (UK Biobank, NIH All of Us, dbGaP), and I’m passionate about using data to support **public health and health equity**.
