# Biostatistics Final Project (R + Quarto)

This repository section contains my **Final Project** for graduate-level Statistical Computing / Biostatistics coursework. The project is a cleaned, reproducible version of my R Assignment 3 work, organized as **two Quarto reports** using separate datasets:

- **CTN-0094 report** (clinical trial / demographics + modeling + visualization)
- **Laryngectomy report** (data quality issue identification + reporting + graphics)

## What this demonstrates (Rubric-aligned)
- Reports **render cleanly** with no errors/warnings and no stray/unformatted output
- Code follows **tidyverse style** and is formatted consistently
- Key results (counts, p-values, etc.) are inserted using **inline R code** (no hard-coded values)
- Figures are publication-ready with clear **who/when/what** labels and at least one faceted plot (CTN)
- Methods sections document **R version** and **package versions**
- Uses tables appropriate for reporting (e.g., **gtsummary** demographics table for CTN)

## Files
- `ctn_report.qmd` → rendered output: `ctn_report.html`
- `laryngectomy_report.qmd` → rendered output: `laryngectomy_report.html`

## Notes
This project is shared as a portfolio example of **reproducible reporting**, **applied statistical computing**, and **public-health oriented data analysis** in R/Quarto.
